# Options Pattern in ASP.NET Core

How do you load & validate your Configurations in ASP.NET Core applications from appsettings.json? ðŸ¤”

I wrote about the Options Pattern in ASP.NET Core, which provides strongly-typed classes to access your settings from the appsettings file. In addition to this, the Options pattern also includes features like data annotations validation, startup validations, custom validations, and reloading the latest configurations at runtime using the IOptionsSnapshot & IOptionsMonitor interfaces.
